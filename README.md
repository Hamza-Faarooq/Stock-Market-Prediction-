# Stock-Market-Prediction


This Python script fetches historical stock price data for Apple (AAPL) from the Alpha Vantage API, preprocesses the data, engineers features, trains machine learning models (Linear Regression and Random Forest), evaluates the models, and visualizes the results.

## Prerequisites
